# Health-Monitoring-System
This project is the development of a temperature and humidity monitoring system using the DHT11 sensor and an OLED I2C SSD1306 display with Arduino microcontrollers. The core technology utilizes a combination of an ESP8266 Wi-Fi microcontroller and a MAX30105 sensor. This sensor gathers data on heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature.
