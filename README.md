# Health-Monitoring-System
This project is the development of a temperature and humidity monitoring system using the DHT11 sensor and an OLED I2C SSD1306 display with Arduino microcontrollers. The core technology utilizes a combination of an ESP8266 Wi-Fi microcontroller and a MAX30105 sensor. This sensor gathers data on heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature. 

This project proposes a user-friendly and cost-effective system for monitoring vital health parameters.  The system targets a growing need for accessible health monitoring, particularly for health-conscious individuals and those managing chronic conditions. 

The core technology utilizes a combination of an ESP8266 Wi-Fi microcontroller and a MAX30105 sensor. This sensor gathers data on heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature.  A critical aspect of the project is the user interface.  By leveraging the Blynk IoT platform, the system presents this health data on a mobile application and web app in a clear and concise manner. This ensures users can easily understand their health metrics without technical expertise.

The project emphasizes affordability by employing readily available and inexpensive components. This focus on cost-effectiveness aims to make the system accessible to a wider range of users, empowering them to take a more active role in monitoring their health.

In summary, this project bridges the gap between user-friendliness, affordability, and essential health monitoring capabilities. By offering a clear view of key health metrics, the system empowers users to make informed decisions about theirÂ well-being.
